ðŸš’ WebSocket API for Finnish rescue service events

## API

The server will publish all new events as they happen to all WebSocket clients currently connected to `/websocket/`. Events are serialized in the following format using JSON:

```json
{
    "type": "palohÃ¤lytys",
    "location": "Harjavalta",
    "time": "2020-04-15T18:57:00+02:00",
    "description": "15.04.2020 18:57:00 Harjavalta/Harjavalta palohÃ¤lytys"
}
```

The latest event is always published to all WebSocket clients when they connect.

## How to use

Start the server:

```bash
go run cmd/server/server.go --host localhost --port 8000
```

Or use Docker:

```bash
docker build -t catastrophe .
docker run -d catastrophe
```

And then you can connect a WebSocket client using JavaScript for example:

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8000/websocket")
socket.onmessage = (msg) => console.log(msg);
```

## How to run tests

To run all tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Note

I wrote this service mainly to experiment with Go. If you're interested in a more thorough service with an actual database layer, as well as a REST API, then take a look at [rescue-events-api](https://github.com/coocos/rescue-events-api).
